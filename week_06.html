	<p> Halfway through this course I have learned a lot of things, the most  <br> 
        surprising thing being coding face filters and coding in general, I have <br>
        learned a lot about coding, when i’ve never experienced it before, I <br>
        learned how to make objects move with body movements and that was one of  <br>
        the most surprising things that I have learned. My midterm project was a  <br>
        face filter, and based on the feedback that I got from the professors,  <br>
        during my presentation. I now know that I should make my face filter  <br>
        more interactive and use AR and add 3d elements into my filter, I also  <br>
        know that I should change some of the typography on my website to make it  <br>
        easy on the eyes and readable. I will incorporate this into my project by  <br>
        learning how to use AR and adding 3D elements into my filter, to make it more  <br>
        interactive with the user, and help the user feel as if they are in that  <br>
        digital world. The biggest barrier that is stopping me from achieving my  <br>
        goal in this course is the lack of experience with these kinds of technology <br>
        (AR & 3D models) in order to help me achieve this goal, I will do more  <br>
        research and watch videos to help me understand how to add AI into my  <br>
        filter, and also study the world of Coraline to help create a more <br>
        realistic version of that imaginary world to make it seem more realistic <br>
        and feel as if the user is in that world. Another thing that is   <br>
        stopping me from achieving my goals is the lack of ideas, currently <br>
        being in an art-block has kept me back in this course, and giving <br>
        myself time to come up with creative and innovative ideas for my projects  <br>
         will help me excel in this course.

            <p> Augmented reality is like a mix of the real and digital world. It uses graphics, audio, <br>
                text, and other digital information into the real world, and real world objects. Using AR <br>
                and the features of AR, I will incorporate it into my project by making it feel as if the <br>
                user is stepping into the world of ‘Coraline’, by using these effects I will be able to  <br>
                add onto the face filter to make it seem more real life and interactive, allowing the user to <br>
                enter this realm via the digital server and by using the technology AR has to offer. Some <br>
                limitations I may face while using AR is fitting / rendering the objects into the real world <br>
                correctly, by using correct sizes and proportions because of the different devices available <br>
                I may have to make it work using only one type of computer. I will be adding the AR by using <br>
                codes such as the < a-marker-camera preset=‘hiro’> < /a-marker-camera>, < a-marker type=<br>
                ’pattern’ url=’path/to/pattern-marker.patt’>< /a-marker>, and < a-entity camera> <br>
                < /a-entity>.
